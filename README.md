## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

- I learnt how to use box-shadow to create shadows on objects
- I also learnt how to use transitions in objects
- I have also improved using background images and how to center divs perfectly.

### Continued development

Add some javascript to improve the website functionality.

### Useful resources

- [Mdn Docs](https://www.example.com) - I used MDN docs for learning the transition of the box shadow and how to apply box shadow to objects in css
